// Simple setup file for Jest tests
// Since we're focusing on testing the GameModel first, we don't need React Testing Library yet

// This is an empty setup file for now
// We'll add more configuration as needed for specific tests

// Adding empty export to make this a module file instead of a script file
export {};
