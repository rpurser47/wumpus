Create or revise a specification document for the code in this repository in a file named SPECIFICATION.md using markdown format in the doc folder. Use the README.md and the code in the project as a source of information. The intended audience is a software engineer with no familiarity with the code base or the problem being solved. Please ensure the documentation is clear, comprehensive, and maintainable. It should be written as if the code did not yet exist.

It is critical that you follow these instructions:

- Format the documentation in GitHub-flavored Markdown
- All diagrams should be properly formatted Mermaid.
- Make references to the code where relevant
- Create Mermaid diagrams for visualizing flows and class diagrams
- Clear section headers and subheaders
- Create links to relevant external documentation or background information.
- At the beginning and end of the document, add the comment "This documentation was generated by AI on <date>."

VERY IMPORTANT:When a function or section of code is mentioned, create relative links to the source files, for example: foo.m.

- When referencing a file: (foo.m)[./src/foo.m]
- When referencing specific line numbers: (foo.m:13)[./src/foo.m:13]
- When referencing multiple lines of code: (foo.m:1-20)[./src/foo.m:1-20]
